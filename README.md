# Braintumor-MRI-Image-classification
This project aims to develop a deep learning-based solution for classifying brain MRI images into multiple categories according to tumor type.
It involves building a custom CNN model from scratch and enhancing performance through transfer learning using pretrained models. The project also includes deploying a user-friendly Streamlit web application to enable real-time tumor type predictions from uploaded MRI images.
